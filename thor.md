# Thor: The Realm of Storms

Thor rides the Bifrost to an ancient Asgardian realm torn from time. Lightning tears across the sky. At its heart lies an old enemy: Loki, trying to use the rift’s energy for himself.

Two paths call to the thunder god:
- Storm the Temple of Time where Loki prepares his spell
- Seek Mjölnir’s echo in a chasm of shattered timelines

**What does Thor do?**
- Confront Loki in the Temple
- Follow Mjölnir’s call into the chasm
