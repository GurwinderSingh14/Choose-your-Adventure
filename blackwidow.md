# Black Widow: Infiltration in the Red Zone

Natasha Romanoff slips into The Red Zone — a secret base in Siberia rumored to be the origin of the rift. It’s crawling with mercenaries and corrupted ex-Red Room agents.

Two infiltration options present themselves:
- Hack into the command center via underground tunnels
- Pose as a defector and enter through the front gate

**What does Black Widow do?**
- Sneak through the tunnels
- Go undercover through the front
