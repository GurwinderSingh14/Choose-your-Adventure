# Iron Man: Quantum Heist in New Tokyo

Tony Stark flies into the heart of a futuristic Tokyo, where AIM is attempting to harness quantum energy to stabilize their own rift. The city glows beneath him, humming with unstable power.

As he scans the area, he spots:
- A stealth drone hub that could be disabled to blind AIM.
- A glowing reactor core pulsing out of sync with reality.

**What does Iron Man do?**
- Disable the drone hub
- Fly straight to the reactor core
